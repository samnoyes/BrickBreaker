# BrickBreaker
BrickBreaker game made in CSC315 at Phillips Exeter Academy. Coded in Java using the Slick 2D and LWJGL libraries.

Use the arrow keys to move the platform. The ball will bounce to the right if it hits the far right side of the platform and to the left if it hits the far left side. Don't miss â€“ you only have three lives!
